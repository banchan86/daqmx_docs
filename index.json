    "keywords": "How to use Bonsai.DAQmx provides an interface for data acquisition and signal generation on NI hardware using four distinct operators. In order to use any of the operators, you need to specify a collection of physical channels used to acquire or generate signals using the Channels property. Depending on whether you are working with analog or digital signals the properties used to configure physical channels are slightly different. Channels can be automatically enumerated by the visual interface as long as you have the device correctly plugged and configured in the host computer. Working examples for each of these operators can be found in the extended description for each operator, which we cover below. AnalogInput AnalogInput configures and starts a data acquisition task for sampling voltage measurements from one or more physical analog input channels. Samples from each channel will be collected in a sample buffer, where each row corresponds to a channel in the acquisition task, and each column to a sample from each of the channels. The order of the channels follows the order in which you specify the channels in the Channels property. If no input source is specified, data will be collected asynchronously every time a new buffer is filled. Alternatively, if an input observable sequence is provided, a new data buffer will be collected every time a new notification is emitted by the input source. AnalogOutput AnalogOutput configures and starts a task for generating voltage signals in one or more physical analog output channels. Voltage samples for each channel are read from sample buffers in the source sequence, where each row corresponds to one of the channels in the signal generation task, and each column to a sample from each of the channels. The order of the channels follows the order in which you specify the channels in the Channels property. Signals can be generated continuously, where a ring buffer is constanty updated with new data arriving from the source sequence. Alternatively, signals can also be generated with a finite number of samples, in which case the input buffers will provide samples until the specified buffer size is reached. In this case, the operator will wait for the task to finish generating the specified number of samples. DigitalInput DigitalInput configures and starts a data acquisition task for sampling logical values from one or more digital input lines. Logical values will be collected in a sample buffer, where each sample can represent either a single line or a bitmask representing the state of all digital lines in a single port, depending on the configuration of the virtual channel. Each row corresponds to a channel in the acquisition task, and each column to a sample from each of the channels. The order of the channels in the sample buffer follows the order in which you specify the channels in the Channels property. Digital lines can be grouped as a port when creating the local virtual channel, either by specifying a range of lines (e.g. Dev1/port0/line0:3) or by specifying an entire port at once (e.g. Dev1/port0). If no input source is specified, samples will be collected asynchronously every time a new buffer is filled. Alternatively, if an input observable sequence is provided, a new sample buffer will be collected every time a new notification is emitted by the input source. DigitalOutput DigitalOutput configures and starts a task for writing logical values to one or more digital output lines. Logical values for each line are read from sample buffers in the source sequence, where each row corresponds to one of the channels in the signal generation task, and each column to a sample from each of the channels. The order of the channels follows the order in which you specify the channels in the Channels property. Each logical value sample can represent either a single line or a bitmask representing the state of all digital lines in a single port, depending on the configuration of the virtual channel. Digital lines can be grouped as a port when creating the local virtual channel, either by specifying a range of lines (e.g. Dev1/port0/line0:3) or by specifying an entire port at once (e.g. Dev1/port0). Signals can be generated continuously, where a ring buffer is constanty updated with new data arriving from the source sequence. Logical values can also be provided by a source of integers specifying a bitmask with the state of all digital lines in a single port. Alternatively, signals can also be generated with a finite number of samples, in which case the input buffers will provide samples until the specified buffer size is reached. In this case, the operator will wait for the task to finish generating the specified number of samples."

    "keywords": "docfx-tools A docfx template for package documentation, patching the modern template to provide stylesheets and scripts for rendering custom workflow containers with copy functionality. How to use To include this template in a docfx website, first clone this repository as a submodule: git submodule add https://github.com/bonsai-rx/docfx-tools bonsai Then modify docfx.json to include the template immediately after the modern template: \"template\": [ \"default\", \"modern\", \"bonsai/template\", \"template\" ], Finally, import and call the modules inside your website template/public folder. main.css @import \"workflow.css\"; main.js import WorkflowContainer from \"./workflow.js\" export default { start: () => { WorkflowContainer.init(); } } Powershell Scripts This repository also provides helper scripts to automate several content generation steps for package documentation websites. Exporting workflow images Exporting SVG images for all example workflows can be automated by placing all .bonsai files in a workflows folder and calling the below script pointing to the bin directory to include. A bonsai environment is assumed to be available in the .bonsai folder in the repository root. .\\modules\\Export-Image.ps1 \"..\\src\\PackageName\\bin\\Release\\net472\""

    "keywords": "Getting Started Bonsai.DAQmx is a Bonsai package that allows interfacing with data acquisition and control hardware from National Instruments within a workflow. The following operators for acquiring and generating signals from either digital or analog channels are provided: AnalogInput AnalogOutput DigitalInput DigitalOutput Each operator supports acquiring or generating both single and multi-channel data, using either finite or continuous sampling. Input sources can acquire samples either synchronously (with an input), or asynchronously (with no input). Examples are provided for some of the most common applications. How to install Bonsai.DAQmx provides a bridge between the DAQmx driver and Bonsai. The Bonsai.DAQmx package can be downloaded through the Bonsai package manager. However, the package itself is not an installer for NI acquisition runtime and SDK. You need to install a compatible version of the DAQmx runtime for your hardware from the NI website. Make sure that the .NET Framework 4.x Language Support optional feature is selected when you install the driver. If you have installed both the package and drivers and find that the operators are not showing up in the Bonsai toolbox, please modify your NI-DAQmx installation and make sure the feature is enabled. Also verify that you have installed the 64-bit NI-DAQmx driver if you are running Bonsai in a 64-bit environment, or 32-bit NI-DAQmx driver if you are running in a 32-bit environment."
